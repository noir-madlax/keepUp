1
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,400
Peace in the war

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,679
Benevolence and cruelty

3
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,339
I tread my own path in this divided land

4
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,619
The fields are busy

5
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:41,299
A big harvest requires many hands

6
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,198
That the other

7
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,319
And merchant looks uneasy

8
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,739
I will not tolerate this to suspect

9
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:37,019
Well you are a friendly beast

10
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:38,500
Are you not

11
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,939
Some i said this way

12
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,780
I beg you hurry

13
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,359
Sir

14
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,299
Please

15
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:51,480
Right behind you

16
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,420
Little one

17
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,840
Oh baba

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,799
I brought someone in my room

19
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,879
I wonder where you wait

20
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:10,658
A samurai

21
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:13,479
One that does not hail from these ants

22
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,479
I am a stranger

23
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,158
Yes

24
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:17,439
But you have nothing to fear from me

25
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:21,539
I have enough to fear from the men of kushyama

26
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,439
They abuse their power

27
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,560
Taxing us again and again

28
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,778
Leaving us only scraps

29
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,718
I bet they are in the market now

30
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,180
Along the main road

31
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,759
A stranger might make good merit

32
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,280
Leading a village of a threat

33
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Like these men

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,120
Is that so then i shall see it done for this life

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,960
If not the next

36
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,599
What is happening here

37
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
This isn't your fight

38
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,099
Samurai

39
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,860
I told you keep walking

40
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,079
Make your peace

41
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,259
You won't need to kill me

42
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,360
Thank you

43
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,889
There's another of the world for the castle of corrupt samurai would

44
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,459
Greed cannot rule this village

45
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:13,579
Not while i have breath in my lungs

46
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,079
And a blade in my head

47
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,759
I'll wash away his failure with your blood

48
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,639
You have to spill it first

49
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,480
Who do you think you are for the people

50
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,300
I was going to handle this

51
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,899
Too slow

52
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:32,779
What did you find

53
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,819
This samurai has been stealing from the villagers

54
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,120
He has been staffing the people here for some time

55
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,040
So now we know who he worked for

56
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,660
We should go not before we send our allies to look for him

57
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,560
He'll be difficult to find

58
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,379
Who will take the lead

59
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:10,199
We can sneak in or just through the front gate

60
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,560
It's almost dark

61
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,220
No one will see me coming

62
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,079
They will not stand a chance

63
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,699
But be careful in there

64
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,540
Don't worry

65
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,560
I won't be alone

66
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,899
It'll be me in the shadows

67
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:36,560
The shadows to serve the light

68
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,178
I'll go straight for the dino when fighting a snake

69
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:46,339
Why wrestle the body when you can slice off the head

70
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,500
You're my now snake

71
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,259
Who did that

72
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,720
Lord

73
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,879
How i cannot seem to stay to war

74
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,399
A grave

75
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,159
Huh

76
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,340
He's coming

77
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,799
I need to hide

78
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,299
Fujioka dies in the street at the hands of some stranger

79
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,559
You serve me scalding tea

80
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,320
Besides ruining its delicate flavour

81
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,899
I nearly lose my tongue of this

82
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,599
Frioka must have been the samurai yasi took out good riddance

83
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,799
Take your time

84
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,019
A daimyo

85
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:11,700
Like that

86
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,698
Deserves a slower death than the one i'm about to give him

87
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,200
I've shed all the blood

88
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,240
I need time to go

89
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,480
To being allies
